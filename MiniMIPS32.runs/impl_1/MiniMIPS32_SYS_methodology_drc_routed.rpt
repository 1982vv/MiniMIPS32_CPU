Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/exe_hilo_o3__0 of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/exe_hilo_o3__1 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning

SYNTH-10#5 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/mulres of size 15x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#6 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/mulres__0 of size 15x15, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#7 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/mulres__1 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#8 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at minimips32/exe_stage0/mulres__2 of size 18x15, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>
